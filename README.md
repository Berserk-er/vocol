VoCol - Vocabulary collaboration and build environment.
=====

Linked Data vocabularies are a crucial building block of the Semantic Data Web and semantic-aware data-value chains.
Vocabularies  reflect a consensus among experts in a certain application domain. 
They are thus implemented in collaboration of domain experts and knowledge engineers. Particularly the presence of domain experts with little technical background requires a low-threshold vocabulary engineering environment.

Inspired by agile software and content development methodologies, the VoCol methodology and tool environment addresses this requirement. 
VoCol is implemented without dependencies on complex software components, it provides collaborators with comprehensible feedback on syntax and semantics errors in a tight loop, and gives access to a human-readable presentation of the vocabulary. 
The VoCol environment is employing loose coupling of validation and documentation generation components on top of a standard Git repository. 
All VoCol components, even the repository engine, can be exchanged with little effort.

##Required libraries
	- Python 2.7
	- Java 1.7+
	- Raptor RDF Syntax Library [1]
	- Schemaorg engine [2]
	- Some Webserver for running VoCol

##Installation on a web server
	1. Configuring vocolJob.sh
		* GITHUB_TOKEN=<client_token>
		* GITHUB_REPOSITORY=<git_repository_path> (e.g.: "Mobivoc/Mobivoc")
		* INTERVAL= <intervall_in_minutes> (e.g.: 5)
	2. Setting up a cron job on the web server which executes vocolJob.sh in the defined interval. 

## Installation using a Virtual Machine Image (Vagrant)
Within the /vargrant folder, you will find the required BoxFiles for setting up the whole environment. 

##How it works

By running vocolJob.sh in a predefined interval (e.g. 5min) as a cron job on some Webserver, it checks for new commits in the defined github repository and collectes all touched vocabulary files. These files are validated and in case of syntax errors, they are automatically reported as GitHub issues (with a notification to the commiter). In case the new vocabulary version is valid, it is automaticially published in a human-friend and machine-comprehensible way.
