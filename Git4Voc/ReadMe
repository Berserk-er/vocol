In order to use Git4Voc, following steps must be performed:

1. Hooks folder should be copied to your repository.

2. Script InstallHooksAndTools should be executed (this will copy predefined hooks to .git/hooks folder and download tools: (1) [Widoco](https://github.com/dgarijo/Widoco); (2) [Parrot](https://bitbucket.org/fundacionctic/parrot/wiki/Home); (3) [RDF-Toolkit](https://github.com/edmcouncil/rdf-toolkit) and (4) [Owl2VCS](https://github.com/utapyngo/owl2vcs) and file templates.zip which contains templates used for generating artefacts).

After successful installation, pre-commit hook will be executed on each commit to perform syntax validation using Rapper and scanning for pitfalls using OOPS web service and rdf-toolkit for normalization/formatting of vocabulary files.

Post-commit hooks will generate documentation for modified files using Widoco and generate semantic diffs using Owl2VCS.
