element types and their structures, as well as their interaction types, among each other and with their environment. Describing this, a Reference Architecture defines restrictions for an instantiation (concrete architecture). Through abstraction from individual details, a Reference Architecture is universally valid within a specific domain. Further architectures with the same functional requirements can be constructed based on the reference architecture. Along with reference architectures comes a recommendation, based on experiences from existing developments as well as from a wide acceptance and recognition by its users or per definition.
